            "description": `Creative writing is an art of sorts - the art of making things up. It's writing done in a way that is not academic or technical but still attracts an audience. Though the definition is rather loose, creative writing can for the most part be considered any writing that is original and self-expressive. A news article, for example, cannot be considered creative writing because its main goal is to present facts and not to express the feelings of the writer. While a news article can be entertaining, its main purpose is to present the facts.

            "rules" :  `• The most important criterion for judging a creative piece is the author's creativity. How original and creative his piece of work or idea is.
                        <br/>• His grip on the English language. His play of words. That does not mean, vocabulary should be considered as a parameter.
                        <br/>• It goes without saying, the author cannot exceed the said word limit i.e. 350-400 words.
                        <br/>• The creative pieces can be either a short story or a poem or a nonfiction prose.
                        <br/>• The nonfiction prose should not be mistaken for an essay.
                        <br/>• In case of a short story, the story should begin and end with an impact or it should be written in such a manner that it holds the reader's attention.
                        <br/>• As for poetry, a short piece is preferable. Also, special attention should be given to the second point in case of poetry.
                        <br/>• Grammar is not being considered as a parameter. However, it is expected that the writer has a sound knowledge of grammar. It is also expected, that, his piece is not peppered with spelling mistakes.
                        <br/>• The time allotted for creative writing is 60 minutes. A participant will get disqualified once he/she exceeds the said time period. There will be a bell announcing the beginning and ending of the session. A participant has to stop once the bell announcing the ending of the session is rung. 
                        <br/>• Coordinators will announce the topic on spot.  
                        <br/>• In the finals instead of a pronounced topic, a picture will be exhibited and the candidates will be required to write on what they conceptualize from the picture, in any genre they are comfortable with.`,
